Editor: D. BarceloThe herbicide glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, has been used extensively in the past 40 years, under
the assumption that side effects were minimal. However, in recent years, concerns have increased worldwide
about the potential wide ranging direct and indirect health effects of the large scale use of glyphosate. In 2015,
the World Health Organization reclassi ﬁed glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans. A detailed overview
is given of the scienti ﬁc literature on the movement and residues of glyphosate and its breakdown product
aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) in soil and water, their toxicity to macro- and microorganisms, their ef-
fects on microbial compositions and potential indire ct effects on plant, animal a nd human health. Although
the acute toxic effects of glyphosate and AMPA on mammals are low, there are animal data raising the pos-sibility of health effects associated with chronic, u ltra-low doses related to accumulation of these com-
pounds in the environment. Intensive glyphosate us e has led to the selection of glyphosate-resistant
weeds and microorganisms. Shifts in microbial compo sitions due to selective pressure by glyphosate may
have contributed to the proliferation of plant and animal pathogens. Research on a link between glyphosateand antibiotic resistance is still scarce but we hypothesize that the selection pressure for glyphosate-
resistance in bacteria could lead to shifts in microbiom e composition and increases in antibiotic resistance
to clinically important antimicrobial agents. We recommend interdisciplinary research on the associations
between low level chronic glyphosate exposure, distortions in microbial communities, expansion ofKeywords:

1. Introduction
The herbicide glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine, is a bio-
cide with a broad spectrum activity that was introduced for weed con-
trol in agricultural production ﬁelds in 1974 ( Benbrook, 2016 ).
Glyphosate is taken up by the foliage of plants and transported through-out the plant resulting in plant death after several days. Glyphosate is
formulated with various adjuvants ( Li et al., 2005 ), in particular surfac-
tants such as polyoxyethylene amine (POEA), to enhance the uptakeand translocation of the active ingredient in plants. The best known
product formulated with POEA is Roundup® ( Benbrook, 2016 ).
Glyphosate products are used primarily before planting of tradition-
al agricultural crops and after planting of genetically modiﬁ ed
glyphosate-resistant crops ( Duke and Powles, 2009 ). Increasingly,
they have been used for desiccation as a ‘harvest aid ’on traditional
grain crops ( Goffnett et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
2017b ). In addition, glyphosate has been widely used between trees in
orchards and groves ( Maqueda et al., 2017; Schrübbers et al., 2016;
Singh et al., 2011; St. Laurent et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015b) and in
urban areas for weed control along streets and in parks ( Hanke et al.,
2010; Kristoffersen et al., 2008 ). Finally, it has also been applied in wa-
terways to eliminate invading aquatic plants ( Clements et al., 2017;
Monsanto, 2014 ).
As a result of the introduction of glyphosate-resistant soybean
(Glycine max) and canola ( Brassica napus ) in 1996, cotton ( Gossypium
hirsutum) in 1997 and corn ( Zea mays )i n1 9 9 8( Duke, 2015; Myers
et al., 2016 ), as well as the expanding end of season glyphosate use to
facilitate harvesting ( Nelson et al., 2011 ), the total acreage treated
with glyphosate has increased rapidly (see Graphical abstract). The an-nual glyphosate application rates per ha have increased too, for example
on soybeans ( Coupe and Capel, 2016 ), especially due to the develop-
ment of glyphosate-resistant weeds ( Benbrook, 2012 ). In 2012, about
127,000 tons of glyphosate were used in the USA and 700,000 tons
worldwide ( Swanson et al., 2014; US Geological Survey, 2012 ). Glypho-
sate use for agricultural production is now widespread, both in industri-alized and developing countries ( Benbrook, 2016 ).The intensive use of glyphosate has resulted in increasing environ-
mental and plant residues. Glyphosate is quite resistant to degradationdue to the inert C-P linkage in the molecule ( Chekan et al., 2016 ). Nev-
ertheless, it is broken down in dead plant material and soil by various
microorganisms ( Mamy et al., 2016 ); the ﬁrst decomposition product
often is aminomethyl phosphonic acid, AMPA ( Shushkova et al., 2009;
Singh and Singh, 2016; Zhang et al., 2015b ). However, decomposition
of glyphosate takes place in living plants as well as in soils ( Arregui
et al., 2004 ), so that both glyphosate and AMPA residues can be found
in plant products. In second generation glyphosate-resistant crop culti-
vars a gene that encodes for the enzyme glyphosate oxidase was
inse
rted into the plant DNA, so that glyphosate is largely converted
into AMPA and glyoxylate in those plants. As a result, glyphosate resi-dues are negligible while AMPA residues may be considerable ( Alves
Corrêa et al., 2016; Monsanto, 2013 ). In some crop cultivars, a
glyphosate- N-acetyl transferase or GAT gene was inserted to convert
glyphosate to N-acetyl-glyphosate, which is broken down to N-acetyl-
AMPA. In those cultivars all four residues (glyphosate, N-acetyl-glypho-
sate, N-acetyl-AMPA and AMPA) can be found and are often combined
for dietary risk assessment ( FAO, 2006 ). Total residues are mostly
below 5 mg kg
−1but occasionally up to 20 mg kg−1in harvested
grain, fodder and oil crops when glyphosate is used as a ‘harvest aid ’be-
fore full crop maturity ( Cessna et al., 1994, 2000; FAO, 2006;
McNaughton et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2017b). Total residue contents
have been as high as 93 mg kg−1in forage ( FAO, 2006 ).
Due to the large scale and intensive use of glyphosate and its accumu-
lation in the environment and edible products, several major concerns
have arisen in recent years about harmful side effects of glyphosate and
AMPA for soil and water quality, and plant, animal and human health.
Based on recent reports on potential chronic side effects of glyphosate
(Battaglin et al., 2014; Séralini et al., 2014 ), the World Health Organization
reclassi ﬁed the herbicide glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans
in 2015 (Bai and Ogbourne, 2016; EFSA, 2015; Guyton et al., 2015; IARC,
2015 ). Since then, many (about 1000) scienti ﬁc research papers have
been published on glyphosate, especially its potential side effects, in thelast two years, but a comprehensive review is still missing.256 A.H.C. Van Bruggen et al. / Science of the Total Environment 616 –617 (2018) 255 –268

The objectives of this review are to present a critical overview of the
scienti ﬁc literature on (1) glyphosate accumulation in the environment
and plant products, (2) its mode of action and effects on plants and an-
imals, (3) its effects on microbial communities in soil, water, plants, an-
imals and humans and (4) potential effects of shifts in microbial
community composition on plant, animal and human health. An addi-
tional objective is to formulate a hypothesis about a possible relation-ship between resistance to glyphosate and to antibiotics in
microorganisms as a result of the very high glyphosate selection pres-
sure in the environment.
2. Residues in soil, water and plant products
A brief overview of the accumulation of glyphosate and its main deg-
radation product AMPA in the environment is presented to facilitate a
full understanding of their potential side effects on plants, animals and
microbial communities.
2.1. Residues in soil and water
Glyphosate containing herbicides may contaminate soils in and
around treated areas. Glyphosate adsorbs to clay and organic matter,
slowing its degradation by soil microorganisms and leading to accumu-
lation in soils over time ( Banks et al., 2014; Cassigneul et al., 2016;
Okada et al., 2016; Sidoli et al., 2016; Simonsen et al., 2008; Sviridovet al., 2015; Travaglia et al., 2015 ). As a result, glyphosate and its degra-
dation product AMPA may persist for more than a year in soils with highclay content but may quickly wash out of sandy soils ( Bergström et al.,
2011; Okada et al., 2016; Sidoli et al., 2016 ). Glyphosate and AMPA deg-
radation is also strongly dependent on soil pH ( Zhang et al., 2015b ).
In the past, glyphosate was not considered a problem for ground
water and surface water, because it has a relatively low potential to
move through soil and contaminate water sources ( Monsanto, 2002,
2014; Sihtmäe et al., 2013 ). However, despite its attachment to clay
and organic matter, parts of the glyphosate and its metabolite AMPAend up in the dissolved phase in ground water after heavy rain
(Maqueda et al., 2017; Rendón-von Osten and Dzul-Caamal, 2017 ).
Rain and erosion can also transport soil particles with glyphosate andAMPA into surface water ( Table 1 ), where it can remain in the particu-
late phase or be dissolved ( Maqueda et al., 2017; Rendón-von Osten and
Dzul-Caamal, 2017; Wang et al., 2016b; Yang et al., 2015 ). Dissolved
glyphosate and AMPA in surface water can sorb to the bottom sediment.Contaminated particles can settle and become incorporated in the bot-
tom sediment as well ( Aparicio et al., 2013; Maqueda et al., 2017 ). Bio-
degradation of glyphosate is much slower in sediment than in dissolvedin water ( Wang et al., 2016b ). Glyphosate and AMPA are nowwidespread in a variety of natural waters and sediments ( Aparicio
et al., 2013; Maqueda et al., 2017; Grandcoin et al., 2017; Poiger et al.,
2017 ).
In areas of the USA where genetically modi ﬁed glyphosate-resistant
crops are grown, glyphosate and AMPA occur widely in soil, surface
water and ground water ( Battaglin et al., 2014 ). Glyphosate has been
measured in river water and stream water ( Table 1 ) at levels from 2
to 430 μgl
−1(Battaglin et al., 2005, 2009; Coupe et al., 2011; Mahler
et al., 2017 ). It has also been detected in air and rain during the crop
growing season and in water from spring snow melt ( Battaglin et al.,
2009, 2014; Chang et al., 2011 ). Ultimately glyphosate ends up in sea-
water, where it is highly persistent ( Mercurio et al., 2014 ).
In Europe, where growing genetically modi ﬁed crops is not allowed,
glyphosate has been detected in various water sources (but at lowerlevels than in the USA). Very low concentrations of glyphosate ( b0.1
to 2.5 μgl
−1) were detected in samples of surface water in Germany
(Skark et al., 1998 ), Switzerland ( Poiger et al., 2017 ), Hungary ( Mörtl
et al., 2013 ) and northeastern Spain ( Sanchis et al., 2012 ). Higher levels
(up to 165 μgl−1) were sometimes found in France ( Villeneuve et al.,
2011 ) and Denmark ( Rosenbom et al., 2010 ).
Very little is known about glyphosate residues in the environment in
other continents ( Table 1 ). In particular, hardly any information is pub-
licly available about environmental residues in China (publications in
Chinese checked by He Miaomiao), while most glyphosate is currently
produced in China ( http://www.cnchemicals.com/Newsletter/
NewsletterDetail_14.html ;Zhang et al., 2015a ) and glyphosate is used
intensively in that country ( Zhang et al., 2015a ).
Besides runoff from agricultural land, urban runoff is also a source of
glyphosate to streams and rivers ( Grandcoin et al., 2017; Hanke et al.,
2010 ). Because runoff is enhanced from impervious and connected
paved surfaces, glyphosate use on paved surfaces is banned in several
countries in Northern Europe ( Kristoffersen et al., 2008; Rosenbom
et al., 2010 ). Nevertheless, glyphosate and AMPA were found in samples
of sewage and stormwater over ﬂows ( Birch et al., 2011 )a sw e l la st h e
outlets from wastewater treatments plants ( Grandcoin et al., 2017 )
and even in bottled water ( Rendón-von Osten and Dzul-Caamal,
2017 ). Glyphosate and AMPA are commonly found in drinking-water
(WHO, 2005 ), but at very low concentrations below the acceptable
daily intake as determined in 1997 ( WHO, 2005 ).
2.2. Residues in plant products
Until recently, residue measurements in plant products were fo-
cused on the active ingredient glyphosate and less on its degradation
product AMPA. However, since it became known that glyphosate is par-
tially broken down to AMPA in living plants ( Arregui et al., 2004 ) and
AMPA is also toxic to various organisms ( Gomes et al., 2016;

Kwiatkowska et al., 2014a, 2014b ), both glyphosate and AMPA are con-
sidered in residue analyses and regulations ( Codex Alimentarius, 2013;
EPA, 2013 ). The concentrations of glyphosate plus AMPA vary widely,
ranging from 0.1 –100 mg kg−1in legumes (including soybeans), 0.1 –
25 mg kg−1in cereals and rice, 0.1 –28 mg kg−1in oil seeds and 1 –
344 mg kg−1in various types of fodder ( Arregui et al., 2004; Bøhn
et al., 2014; Çetin et al., 2017; Cuhra, 2015; FAO, 2006 ). The maximum
residue limits of glyphosate plus AMPA in farm products vary widely
too, ranging from 0.05 mg kg−1in milk, 0.1 mg kg−1in most plant prod-
ucts, 10 –20 mg kg−1in seeds and up to 500 mg kg−1in fodder ( Codex
Alimentarius, 2013; Cuhra, 2015; EPA, 2013; FAO, 2006 ). The tolerable
residue levels in seeds and fodder have increased over time to accom-modate increasing concentrations detected in some farm products
(Benbrook, 2016 ). Tolerable residue limits in China are similar to
those elsewhere ( Meador and Jie, 2014 ).
Residues of glyphosate and AMPA in water and plant products are
taken up by animals and humans and excreted in their faeces andurine ( Niemann et al., 2015; von Soosten et al., 2016 ). Glyphosate was
detected in the urine of a high proportion (30 –80%) of farm animals
and humans ( Krüger et al., 2014a, 2014b; Niemann et al., 2015 ). Resi-
dues were found not only in the urine of farmers but also in 60 –80% of
the general public, including children, in the USA and in 44% of the gen-
eral public in Europe ( Krüger et al., 2014a; Niemann et al., 2015 ). The
concentrations in human urine samples were low, but higher amongsubjects in the USA (mean 2 –3μgl
−1and maximum 233 μgl−1)t h a n
in Europe (mean b1μgl−1and maximum 5 μgl−1)(Niemann et al.,
2015 ). Yet, exposure calculations have indicated that daily exposures
to glyphosate are generally less than the tolerable reference dose as cur-rently maintained by regulatory agencies ( Solomon, 2016; WHO, 2005 ).
However, these tolerance levels and safety standards are being chal-lenged in view of the expanded human exposures ( Vandenberg et al.,
2017 ).
3. Effects of glyphosate on plants, animals and microorganisms
The biocidal activity of glyphosate is associated with the inhibition of
the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS).Glyphosate thus stops the sixth step in the shikimate pathway (conver-
sion from shikimate-3-phosphate to EPSP), which is required for the
production of aromatic amino acids and secondary compounds with de-
fense functions in plants and many microorganisms ( Funke et al., 2006;
Krüger et al., 2013; Schrödl et al., 2014 ).
3.1. Effects on plants
Glyphosate is toxic to both monocotyledonous plants (such as
grasses) and dicotyledonous plants (most broad leaf plants). Uptakeand translocation of glyphosate in plants is enhanced by surfactants in
the formulated product. Translocation takes place both acropetally
and basipetally (upwards and downwards), so that glyphosate accumu-
lates throughout the plant including in seeds and plant roots ( Li et al.,
2005; Walker and Oliver, 2008 ). Glyphosate and its breakdown product
AMPA inhibit antioxidant enzyme activities and induce the accumula-
tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce physiological dysfunc-
tion and cell damage ( Gomes et al., 2016 ). Both glyphosate and AMPA
decrease photosynthesis, but through different mechanisms: glypho-sate increases chlorophyll degradation, while AMPA disturbs chloro-
phyll biosynthesis ( Gomes et al., 2016 ). Both enhanced chlorophyll
degradation and reduced biosynthesis result in yellowing and necrosisof foliage.
Plants treated with glyphosate do not produce secondary aromatic
compounds, including antimicrobial phytoalexins that defend plants
against pathogens. Consequently, glyphosate treated plants frequently
die from infection by root pathogens that are universally present in
soil ( Babiker et al., 2011; Johal and Rahe, 1984; Lee et al., 2012;
Meriles et al., 2008; Rashid et al., 2013; Rosenbaum et al., 2014 ). Evensublethal glyphosate concentrations in plants, for example from resi-dues in soil or water, diminish plant resistance to pathogens. Infection
byFusarium species is often more severe in ﬁelds where glyphosate
was applied before planting of a crop compared with untreated controlﬁelds ( Kremer et al., 2005; Kremer and Means, 2009; Sanogo et al.,
2000; St. Laurent et al., 2008; van Bruggen et al., 2015 ). For example,
soybean sudden death syndrome (caused by Fusarium virguliforme )
was sometimes increased by glyphosate application in both
glyphosate-tolerant and sensitive cultivars that were susceptible to
the disease ( Kremer and Means, 2009; Sanogo et al., 2000, 2001 ), but
not always ( Duke et al., 2012; Kandel et al., 2015 ). Infection of sugar
beet ( Beta vulgaris ) by weakly pathogenic Fusarium andRhizoctonia spe-
cies was also enhanced after glyphosate application before plantingsugar beet seeds ( Larson et al., 2006 ). Yet, spore germination and myce-
lium growth of these and other pathogens are often reduced in vitro(Barnett et al., 2012; Larson et al., 2006; Mengistu et al., 2013; Sanogo
et al., 2000; Sanyal and Shrestha, 2008 ). This supports the notion that
increased root disease in glyphosate treated soil comes about through
reduced plant resistance rather than enhanced pathogen growth or
that glyphosate may suppress bene ﬁcial microorganisms more than
plant pathogens like Fusarium species.
In addition to reduced plant resistance, indirect effects of glyphosate
andAMPA
on plant health are possible through changes in the endo-
phytic and rhizosphere microbiome ( Berg et al., 2014; Finckh et al.,
2015; Kremer et al., 2005; Kuklinsky-Sobral et al., 2005; van Bruggenand Finckh, 2016; van Bruggen et al., 2016 ). The importance of the
plant microbiome for plant health has been known for a long time(Kloepper et al., 1980; Pleban et al., 1995 ). The plant microbiome com-
position is largely determined by plant species and the soil where aplant is growing, including the soil microbiome as affected by pesticide
use ( Finckh et al., 2015 ; see also Section 3.3.1 of this review). Besides a
reduction in plant resistance as a result of changes in microbial compo-sition after glyphosate use, attraction of plant pathogens to the roots of
glyphosate-resistant plants can be enhanced by increased exudation of
carbohydrates and amino acids from roots of glyphosate treated plants
(Kremer et al., 2005; Kremer and Means, 2009 ).
Another agricultural problem that has arisen in response to intensive
glyphosate use is the widespread appearance of glyphosate-resistant
weed species ( Duke and Powles, 2009; Green and Owen, 2011;
Schafer et al., 2014; Shaner et al., 2012 ). Glyphosate-resistance in plants
can be conferred by several different mechanisms ( Table 2 )s u c ha s
changes in translocation as a result of modi ﬁed transporter genes, single
point mutations of the target site making it insensitive, increased targetexpression or detoxi ﬁcation of the herbicide ( Chekan et al., 2016;
Pollegioni et al., 2011; Shaner et al., 2012; Tani et al., 2016; Zhanget al., 2015a ). Recently, alternative glyphosate-resistance genes were
found that could be incorporated into genetically modi ﬁed crops in
the near future ( Staub et al., 2012; Tao et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2015),
but different resistance mechanisms may evolve again in weeds ex-posed to glyphosate repeatedly.
In reaction to the glyphosate-resistance problem, farmers have in-
creased the dosage and frequency of glyphosate use even further
(Benbrook, 2012 ), and companies producing glyphosate-resistant
crops added genes for resistance to other herbicides, 2,4-D and dicamba,in those crops ( Duke and Powles, 2009; Leon et al., 2016; Ruen et al.,
2017 ). However, weeds with multiple herbicide resistance at multiple
sites of action will likely emerge soon after the widespread use of
these herbicides ( Bell et al., 2013 ). This may then lead to an additional
increase in herbicide use and additional unintended side effects(Landrigan and Benbrook, 2015 ).
3.2. Effects on animals and humans
The absence of the shikimate pathway in animals is the basis for the
lack of acute toxicity of glyphosate in animals such as mammals, am-
phibians and reptiles after a single exposure to relatively high dosages258 A.H.C. Van Bruggen et al. / Science of the Total Environment 616 –617 (2018) 255 –268
Page 5:
(McComb et al., 2008; Weir et al., 2016 ). However, the median lethal
doses vary considerably for different formulations, especially with re-
spect to surfactants ( Diamond and Durkin, 1997; Durkin, 2011 ). Formu-
lations containing POEA are relatively toxic compared to otherformulations. Lethal doses of the most toxic formulations are species
speciﬁ c varying from 175 to 540 mg glyphosate acid equivalent
(a.e.) kg
−1body weight for terrestrial animal species and from 1 to
52 mg a.e. l−1of water for aquatic species ( Durkin, 2011 ). However,
the glyphosate sensitivity of these two groups cannot be compared di-rectly because the method of exposure is quite different for these
groups.
3.2.1. Terrestrial animals and humans
Although the acute oral toxicity of technical grade glyphosate to
mammals is low, with the LD
50ranging from 800 to N5000 mg kg−1
body weight for different animal species ( McComb et al., 2008; WHO,
2009 ), there is increasing interest in potential chronic effects of formu-
lated glyphosate and its degradation products as they accumulate in the
environment ( Bai and Ogbourne, 2016; Battaglin et al., 2014; Greim
et al., 2015; Mesnage et al., 2015a; Séralini et al., 2014 ). Two research
approaches have been taken to investigate chronic effects: correlative
research and experimental studies that address possible causative
relationships.
Correlations have been found between increased glyphosate use and
a wide variety of human diseases, including various forms of cancer, kid-
ney damage and mental conditions such as ADHD, autism, Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's disease ( Fluegge and Fluegge, 2016; Fortes et al.,
2016; Jayasumana et al., 2014; Mesnage et al., 2015b; Swanson et al.,2014 ). Miscarriages and dermatological and respiratory illnesses were
related to glyphosate exposure during aerial glyphosate spraying cam-paigns to eliminate coca plants in Colombia ( Camacho and Mejía,
2017 ). Increases in infertility and malformation among pigs were corre-
lated with glyphosate concentrations in the liver and kidneys and with
residues in the feed ( Krüger et al., 2014a, 2014b ). Various confounding
factors might have contributed to these correlations. Therefore, con-trolled experiments are essential to determine chronic toxic effects.
Under experimental conditions with cell cultures, glyphosate and its
breakdown product AMPA increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in human erythrocyte cultures at moderately high concentrations
(N42 mg l
−1of either pure glyphosate or AMPA) for 24 h
(Kwiatkowska et al., 2014a)( Table 3 ). AMPA is a glutamic acid receptorin the central nervous system ( Catarzi et al., 2006 ). Both glyphosate and
AMPA decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in erythrocyte cultures
(Kwiatkowska et al., 2014b ). Acetylcholinesterase catalyzes the break-
down of acetylcholine that functions as a neurotransmitter. Decreasedacetylcholinesterase activity by organophosphorus compounds hinders
the termination of synaptic transmission. Neural cell development and
axon growth of rats were impaired after exposure to a high dose of
glyphosate (4000 mg l
−1)f o r2 4h( Coullery et al., 2016 ).
In other laboratory studies, exposure of human peripheral blood
cells to glyphosate resulted in DNA damage in leucocytes at moderate
to high concentrations (85 to 1690 mg l−1) and decreased DNA methyl-
ation at 42 mg l−1glyphosate in vitro ( Kwiatkowska et al., 2017 ).
Changes in DNA methylation can disturb the balance between cancer-
ous cell proliferation and programmed cell death (apoptosis)
(Hervouet et al., 2013 ). DNA hypomethylation can lead to activation of
oncogenes, while hypermethylation can silence tumor suppressor
genes ( Hervouet et al., 2013 ). Thus, glyphosate and AMPA can disturb
normal neurotransmission and upset the delicate balance between cellproliferation and programmed cell death.
As predicted from correlation and cellular studies ( Table 3 ),
persistent low exposure to glyphosate (about 70 mg of
glyphosate kg
−1body weight day−1) can affect the activity of the en-
zyme acetylcholinesterase at the organismal level ( Cattani et al., 2017;
Kwiatkowska et al., 2014b; Menéndez-Helman et al., 2012 ). If acetyl-
cholinesterase is not working properly, nerve impulses are not switchedoff, causing serious neurological disorders ( Čolovi ćet al., 2013 ). For ex-
ample, chronic exposure of pregnant rats ( Rattus norvegicus )t og l y p h o -
sate (Roundup®) in drinking water (0.36% or 3600 mg a.i. l
−1) led to
oxidative stress and glutamate excitotoxicity in the rat hippocampusand decreased hippocampus acetylcholinesterase activity ( Cattani
et al., 2017 ). This resulted in depressive-like behavior in offspring rats
exposed to glyphosate for 60 days ( Cattani et al., 2017 ).
In another chronic exposure study ( Table 3 ), daily treatments of live
rats with a low dose (56 mg kg
−1) of Roundup® for 5 or 13 weeks re-
sulted in biochemical and anatomical liver damage ( Çağlar and
Kolankaya, 2008 ). Chronic exposure (2 yr) to Roundup® at ultralow
doses (50 ng l−1;4n gk g−1bw d−1) in drinking water caused liver
and kidney damage and various tumors in laboratory rats ( Mesnage
et al., 2015a; Séralini et al., 2014 ), although conclusions regarding pos-
sible carcinogenicity have been disputed by researchers associated
with the industry and others ( EFSA, 2015; Greim et al., 2015 ). RecentTable 2

work by Mesnage et al. (2016) further demonstrated that the chronic
(2 year) exposure of rats to these ultralow dosage levels of Roundup®
resulted in marked alterations of the liver proteome and metabolome,changes which overlap substantially with non-alcoholic fatty liver dis-
ease. In the experiments with Roundup®, no distinction was made be-
tween effects of glyphosate and of the adjuvant POEA, although the
estimated acute oral toxicity of POEA is higher (LD
50=1 . 2gk g−1)
than that of glyphosate (LD 50= 4.8 g kg−1)(Diamond and Durkin,
1997 ). However, these experiments were not carried out to estimate
acute oral effects of glyphosate, but chronic effects of the formulatedproduct as encountered in reality.
Finally, repeated application of glyphosate at relatively low doses
(5 mg kg
−1) negatively affected fertility in male rats ( Abarikwu et al.,
2015 ), while a single application had a negative fertility effect at a
high dose (500 mg kg−1)o n l y( Dai et al., 2016 ). Male rats that received
soymilk with 100 mg l−1glyphosate had a decrease in spermatids and
increase in abnormal sperm morphology compared to the soymilk con-
trol ( Nardi et al., 2017 ). Cell cultures of cattle ovaries showed deteriorat-
ed ovarian functions after exposure to low glyphosate concentrations(0.5, 1.7 and 5 mg l
−1) but not at high concentrations (10 and
300 mg l−1), which is typical of endocrine disruptor effects ( Perego
et al., 2017 ). Thus, at low concentrations, glyphosate could have hor-
monal effects and reduce fertility ( Table 3 ), while at high doses various
other organs may be affected, ultimately resulting in death.
3.2.2. Aquatic animals
Glyphosate and the surfactants POEA and MON 0818 (75% POEA)
can have negative impacts on the health of a variety of animals in the
aquatic food web, including protozoa, mussels, crustaceans, frogs and
ﬁsh, similar to the effects on terrestrial animals ( Bringolf et al., 2007;
Durkin, 2011; Li et al., 2017; Moreno et al., 2014; Prosser et al., 2017;Rissoli et al., 2016; Sihtmäe et al., 2013; Tsui and Chu, 2003; Zhang
et al., 2017a ). Glyphosate formulations with POEA are generally more
toxic than those without this surfactant ( Bringolf et al., 2007; Prosser
et al., 2017 ). Aquatic animals seem to be more sensitive to POEA than
terrestrial animals. However, experimentation on health effects of adju-vants by independent entities has been quite limited due to the propri-
etary nature of these chemicals ( Diamond and Durkin, 1997; Durkin,
2011 ). For example, formulations with POEA were more toxic to the
microcrustacean Artemia salina and young zebra ﬁshDanio rerio than
formulations without POEA both at 360 g glyphosate a.e. l
−1water
(Rodrigues et al., 2017 ). Various species of freshwater mussels were
more sensitive to glyphosate with MON 0818 (EC 50= 1 mg a.e. l−1)and Roundup® (EC 50= 4 mg a.e. l−1) than to technical grade glypho-
sate (EC50 N200 mg a.e. l−1)(Bringolf et al., 2007 ). At typical and max-
imum glyphosate application and runoff rates from soil, resulting in
estimated concentrations of 0.21 to 0.99 mg POEA l−1surface water,
21–43% of a wide array of aquatic species were estimated to be impaired
by these POEA concentrations ( Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2017 ).
Similar to effects of glyphosate on terrestrial animals ( Table 3 ), pure
glyphosate suppressed the activity of acetylcholinesterase at low con-
centrations (1 –676 mg l−1) in brown mussels ( Perna perna )(Sandrini
et al., 2013 ) and several ﬁsh species ( Menéndez-Helman et al., 2012;
Sandrini et al., 2013 ). At an ultralow concentration of 0.01 mg l−1glyph-
osate damaged the primary motoneurons in zebra ﬁsh resulting in ab-
normal movements at a young age ( Zhang et al., 2017a ). Exposure of
zebra ﬁsh embryos to higher concentrations of Roundup® (50 mg l−1)
resulted in developmental problems including forebrain, midbrain and
e y ed a m a g e( Roy et al., 2016 ).
Again, similar to glyphosate effects on terrestrial animals, chronic
exposure of gold ﬁsh (Carassius auratus ) to moderately low levels of
glyphosate (34 mg l−1) disturbed the metabolism in various tissues,
led to overproduction of ROS and oxidative stress ( Li et al., 2017 ). The
ﬁnal result was severe renal injury ( Li et al., 2017 ). Even lower concen-
trations of Roundup® (3.6 mg l−1for 4 h) damaged the DNA in blood,
gills and liver of the European eel ( Anguilla anguilla )(Guilherme et al.,
2009 ). Exposure of freshwater carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) to higher levels
of Roundup® (205 mg or 410 mg of glyphosate l−1; still below the
range of commercial applications) induced changes to liver cells and mi-
tochondria ( Szarek et al., 2000 ).
In addition to these direct effects on aquatic animals, glyphosate can
affect the interactions between ﬁsh and their pathogens or parasites. Ex-
posure of silver cat ﬁsh (Rhamdia quelen ) to sublethal concentrations of
glyphosate (0.73 mg l−1,1 0 %o ft h eL C 50for 96 h) reduced the numbers
of blood erythrocytes, thrombocytes, lymphocytes and total leukocytes,decreased immune cell phagocytosis and increased susceptibility to the
pathogen Aeromonas hydrophila , resulting in a decrease in the survival
rate ( Kreutz et al., 2010, 2011 ). Similarly, environmentally relevant con-
centrations (0.36 mg a.i. l
−1) of glyphosate enhanced infection of the
freshwater ﬁshGalaxias anomalus by the trematode ﬂatworm parasite
Telogaster opisthorchis (Kelly et al., 2010 ). However, horsehair worms
(Chordodes nobilii ) parasitic to mosquito larvae ( Aedes aegypti )s h o w e d
reduced infective ability and increased adult mortality following expo-sure to low concentrations (0.1 –8m ga . i .l
−1) of technical grade glyph-
osate and Roundup® ( Achiorno et al., 2008 ). Thus, low levels of
glyphosate in surface water could disturb the balance between hostsTable 3

and pathogens or parasites. This can result in unexpected shifts in
aquatic communities.
3.3. Effects on microorganisms
The shikimate pathway is present not only in plants but also in fungi
and bacteria, rendering many taxa of microorganisms sensitive to
glyphosate. However, not all organisms with the shikimate pathway
are sensitive to glyphosate, depending on the class of EPSPS they pro-
duce: class I EPSPS is glyphosate sensitive and class II EPSPS is
glyphosate-tolerant ( Funke et al., 2007; Priestman et al., 2005 ). For ex-
ample, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain CP4 has a gene coding for the
class II version of EPSPS that is not inhibited by glyphosate ( Padgette
et al., 1995 ). Similar to plants, bacterial and fungal strains with low sen-
sitivity to glyphosate have been selected, largely through the same
mechanisms as the resistance mechanisms identi ﬁed in plants ( Li
et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013; Priestman et al., 2005; Staub et al., 2012 ).
Consequently, differences in sensitivity among microorganisms have af-
fected the microbial composition of various habitats harboring glypho-
sate, including soil, plant surfaces and animal intestinal tracts.
3.3.1. Microorganisms in soil, rhizosphere and plants
Glyphosate is taken up by the foliage of plants and transported
throughout the plant and into the rhizosphere and soil ( Yamada et al.,
2009; Zobiole et al., 2010 ). Because many microorganisms are sensitive
to glyphosate, its application can affect the microbial composition and
enzymatic activity in the plant endosphere, the rhizosphere and sur-
rounding soil ( Arango et al., 2014; Banks et al., 2014; Cherni et al.,
2015; Druille et al., 2015; Schafer et al., 2014 ). For example, glyphosate
treatments (applied at recommended or lower dosages) negatively af-
fected microorganisms that promote plant growth, such as Burkholderia
spp., Pseudomonas spp., arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen ﬁx-
ingRhizobium spp. ( Arango et al., 2014; Druille et al., 2015; Schafer
et al., 2014; Zobiole et al., 2010 ). These treatments resulted in reduced
plant growth and/or changes in grassland vegetation cover and compo-sition ( Arango et al., 2014; Druille et al., 2015 ).
However, there is still much controversy about the effects of glyph-
osate on microbial communities and activities in the soil and rhizo-
sphere ( Allegrini et al., 2015; Hungria et al., 2014; Wolmarans and
Swart, 2014 ). In studies comparing soil treated with glyphosate with
untreated control soil, microbial communities seemed to recover from
short term glyphosate treatment ( Arango et al., 2014; Banks et al.,
2014; Wolmarans and Swart, 2014 ) with only minor or no effect on
global microbial structure, biomass or activity ( Allegrini et al., 2015;
Haney et al., 2000; Meriles et al., 2008; Nakatani et al., 2014; Wardleand Parkinson, 1990; Zabaloy et al., 2016 ), probably due to the great di-
versity and compensatory ability of microorganisms in soil. In addition,direct effects of glyphosate are confounded by increased availability of
dead plant and microbial material, a food source for many microorgan-
isms, including saprotrophic plant pathogenic fungi ( Babiker et al.,
2011; Meriles et al., 2008; Sharma-Poudyal et al., 2016 ).
Speci ﬁc methods that can detect rare microorganisms, shifts in mi-
crobial composition, and changes in metabolic functions resultingfrom glyphosate applications, such as deep sequencing (sequencing of
extracted DNA or RNA multiple times), have been used only by
Schafer et al. (2014) andNewman et al. (2016) .Schafer et al. (2014) in-
vestigated the taxonomic distribution of the microbial community, di-versity and genera abundance within the rhizosphere of glyphosate
susceptible and resistant giant ragweed ( Ambrosia tri ﬁda) biotypes in
response to a glyphosate application. DNA sequences of the pathogensVerticillium andXanthomonas in
 creased and of the bene ﬁcial bacterium
Burkholderia decreased in glyphosate treated soil, but the differences in
microbial community composition were small. Newman et al. (2016)
showed that the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the rhizo-spheres of Roundup-ready® corn and soybeans changed as a result of
long term (3 yr) glyphosate treatment at the recommended dose.RNA-Seq analysis showed that carbohydrate and amino acid metabo-
lism was downregulated in total extracted rhizosphere RNA ( Newman
et al., 2016 ), in agreement with a possible reduction in photosynthesis
(Gomes et al., 2016 ). Iron acquisition and metabolism were also down-
regulated in the rhizosphere ( Newman et al., 2016 ), in agreement with
the reduced availability of iron in glyphosate treated soil ( Cakmak et al.,
2009 ). Protein metabolism and respiration sequences were upregulated
(Newman et al., 2016 ), possibly due to increased amino acid exudation
(Kremer et al., 2005 ).
Minor differences in sensitivity of soil and rhizosphere microorgan-
isms to glyphosate may result in important shifts in plant or animal
pathogens. For example, the root pathogen Fusarium sp. is comparative-
ly insensitive to glyphosate. Thus, glyphosate application may shift thebalance of pathogenic Fusarium spp. and antagonistic microorganisms
such as Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens in favor of the root pathogens
(Kremer and Means, 2009; Yamada et al., 2009; Zobiole et al., 2010 ). In-
creased root rot caused by pathogenic Fusarium spp. in glyphosate treat-
ed soil has been shown repeatedly as mentioned above ( Fernandez
et al., 2009; Johal and Huber, 2009; Rosenbaum et al., 2014; Yamadaet al., 2009 ). Similarly, the human and animal pathogen Staphylococcus
aureus is insensitive to glyphosate and may become more dominant in
glyphosate treated soil ( Funke et al., 2007; Priestman et al., 2005 ).
Thus, the presence of glyphosate in soil could change the communitycompositions of bacteria and fungi, in turn altering soil ecosystem func-
tions and plant and animal health ( Kuklinsky-Sobral et al., 2005; Zobiole
et al., 2010 ).
3.3.2. Microorganisms in water
Negative effects of glyphosate and the surfactant POEA have been
demonstrated for various species of microalgae, aquatic bacteria and
protozoa ( Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2017; Sihtmäe et al., 2013; Tsui and
Chu, 2003 ). The modes of action in aquatic microorganisms are similar
to those in terrestrial plants and microorganisms: glyphosate affects
synthesis of aromatic amino acids, the production of chlorophyll, photo-
synthesis and respiration ( Mensink and Janssen, 1994 ). The marine bac-
terial species Vibrio ﬁscheri was sensitive to moderately low
concentrations of glyphosate in water (EC
50values ranged from 5.4 to
7.6 mg a.e. l−1), regardless of the formulation used (Sihtmäe et al.,
2013 ). Microalgae are generally more sensitive to glyphosate and the
formulated product Roundup® (1.2 –7.8 mg l−1) than are heterotrophic
bacteria, although some species of microalgae are more tolerant thanothers ( Mensink and Janssen, 1994; Tsui and Chu, 2003; Wang et al.,
2016a ).
Autotrophic microorganisms are vital to marine and freshwater eco-
systems, because they form the base of food chains. Photosynthesis, celldensities and growth rates of three microalgae were diminished by ex-
posure to a typical application rate of glyphosate (0.89 kg a.e. ha
−1,
resulting in about 1.2 mg glyphosate l−1and 0.21 mg POEA l−1of sur-
face water) ( Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2017 ). Even a low glyphosate concen-
tration (0.011 mg l−1) inhibited the growth of the autotrophic
community in river water for three weeks, although it did not cause
chlorophyll reduction ( Bricheux et al., 2013 ). Addition of Roundup®
to pond water (6 and 12 mg a.i.−1, higher than the 3.5 mg a.i.−1recom-
mended for weed control) decreased the abundance of total micro- and
nanophytoplankton, but increased the abundance of picocyanobacteria
and overall primary production ( Pérez et al., 2007 ). This increase in
picocyanobacteria was attributed to the direct toxicological effect ofglyphosate on other microorganisms, resulting in release of nutrients
from the dead bodies. In later studies, glyphosate formulated as
Glifosato Atanor® at 3.5 mg a.i. l
−1as well as pure glyphosate and
Glifosato Atanor® at 2.7 –2.9 mg a.e. l−1stimulated the abundance of
bacterioplankton and planktonic picocyanobacteria, and the photosyn-
thetic activity of periphytic algae ( Vera et al., 2012, 2014; Wang et al.,
2016a ). This was attributed to increased phosphorous contents in
glyphosate treated water ( Vera et al., 2012, 2014; Wang et al., 2016a ).
Indeed, a single application of technical grade glyphosate (2.4 mg l−1)261 A.H.C. Van Bruggen et al. / Science of the Total Environment 616 –617 (2018) 255 –268
Page 8:
to tap water in mesocosms that were left outside for 6 months increased
the total phosphorous concentration seven fold (to 0.7 mg l−1)a n d
doubled the density of picocyanobacteria (to 2 ∗10−6cells ml−1in tur-
bid water) after 1 –8d a y s( Pizarro et al., 2016 ).
Similar to the research results obtained for soil, global measures of
microbial activity and diversity were negligibly affected by glyphosate
treatments (0.01 –0.37 mg l−1) of surface water collected from various
water bodies ( Bricheux et al., 2013; Magbanua et al., 2013; Pesce
et al., 2009 ). In situ measurements of microbial activity, diversity and
composition in relation to glyphosate concentrations were confounded
by the presence of other pesticides ( Daouk et al., 2013 ). In controlled
laboratory experiments, however, the growth and species compositionof microbial populations (determined by Temporal Temperature Gradi-
ent Gel Electrophoresis with DNA from marine waters) were sometimes
disturbed at levels of glyphosate (0.001 –0.01 mg l
−1) typical of those
caused by run off from land ( Stachowski-Haberkorn et al., 2008 ).
Thus, similar to the situation in soil, deep sequencing and metabolomics
may be needed to detect subtle shifts in microbial communities in water
(Beale et al., 2017; Muturi et al., 2017; Tromas et al., 2017 ). The results
may be affected by many factors, including the glyphosate formulationand concentration, pH and sediment contents ( Magbanua et al., 2013;
Tsui and Chu, 2003; Wang et al., 2016b ).
3.3.3. Microorganisms in animals
Relationships between microbiomes and human or animal health
have received much attention in recent years ( Berg et al., 2014;
Hoffman et al., 2015; O'Doherty et al., 2014 ), but little research has
been done on the potential in ﬂuence of glyphosate on these relation-
ships. Nevertheless, intestinal microbial communities can be affectedby glyphosate in contaminated animal feed and water. Subsequently,
the changes in these communities can be detrimental to animal health.
For example, lactic acid producing bacteria generally are negatively af-
fected by glyphosate ( Clair et al., 2012; Krüger et al., 2013 ). These bac-
teria normally produce antibiotics and can suppress pathogenicbacteria such as Clostridium botulinum (Krüger et al., 2013; Rodloff and
Krüger, 2012 ) and botulism has increasingly been found in cows ( Bos
taurus ) that had high concentrations of glyphosate in their feed and
urine ( Gerlach et al., 2014; Krüger et al., 2013, 2014a ). During in vitro
fermentation in bovine rumen ﬂuid, several species of bacteria and pro-
tozoa were suppressed after exposure to glyphosate at 1, 10 and
100 mg l
−1(Ackermann et al., 2015 ). However, botulinum neurotoxin
concentration was enhanced at the highest level of glyphosate only(1000 mg l
−1). In poultry ( Gallus gallus domesticus ),Biﬁdobacterium
and Enterococcus spp. were negatively affected by glyphosate at 0.08 –
0.15 mg g−1, while pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella andClostrid-
iumspp. were less sensitive (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration, MIC =
1.2 –5m gg−1)t ot h i sh e r b i c i d e( Shehata et al., 2013 ). The tested con-
centrations were high, but the glyphosate concentration in the poultryfeed was also high: 0.19 –0.4 mg g
−1(Shehata et al., 2014 ).
Glyphosate in animal feed affects not only intestinal bacteria but also
fungi, such as the Mucorales , fast growing fungi often forming spore
balls on top of fungal threads and therefore sometimes called pinmolds. They are common in soil and often cause food spoilage and
sometimes mycoses in animals and humans ( Morace and Borghi,
2012 ). A positive correlation was found between glyphosate concentra-
tions in urine and the density of Mucorales in the rumen of dairy cows in
Germany ( Schrödl et al., 2014 ). This change in the fungal community
could have come about through a disturbance of the intestinal microbi-
ota in general, because members of the Mucorales were resistant to
glyphosate in vitro ( Schrödl et al., 2014 ). However, the observed reduc-
tion in antibodies against the Mucorales may indicate that glyphosate in-
ﬂuenced the immune system of the cows, possibly through the toxic
effects of glyphosate on the liver ( Schrödl et al., 2014 ). Although
Mucorales were resistant to glyphosate in vitro, it is possible that this
change in prevalence was due to a disturbance of other intestinal
microbiota.4. Resistance to glyphosate and antibiotics
Little attention has been paid to potential indirect negative effects of
glyphosate on human and animal health through a possible relationshipbetween resistance to glyphosate and to antibiotics in bacteria ( Fig. 1 ).
In this section, we discuss glyphosate-resistance in bacteria and the po-tential mechanisms underlying this resistance, followed by observed as-sociations between glyphosate-resistance and antibiotic resistance and
a hypothesis about the selection pressure of intensive glyphosate use
driving both forms of resistance.
Although many bacteria and fungi are sensitive to glyphosate, some
are highly resistant ( Fei et al., 2013; Kuklinsky-Sobral et al., 2005;
Natarajan et al., 2007; Wolmarans and Swart, 2014 ). For example, strain
CP4 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens was found in the wastewater of a
glyphosate production plant and was highly resistant to glyphosate.This resistance is conferred by the gene coding for the enzyme CP4
EPSP synthase (EPSPS), which was inserted into crops to provide
glyphosate-resistance ( Padgette et al., 1995 ). A truncated form of the
same enzyme was transferred experimentally from glyphosate-resistant plants to Escherichia coli, providing similar resistance as the
original full length enzyme ( Natarajan et al., 2007 ). Other functional
genes of the glyphosate-resistant E. coli as well as its carbon utilization
proﬁle were only slightly affected by the inserted EPSP synthase gene,
suggesting that this genetically modi ﬁedE. coli could survive in the en-
vironment ( Li et al., 2015 ). This implies that glyphosate-resistance could
potentially return from plants to bacteria by horizontal gene transfer,
and that the resulting glyphosate-resistant bacteria might successfully
survive in the environment ( Li et al., 2015 ). Although horizontal gene
transfer by natural means has not been demonstrated conclusively,glyphosate-resistance has been identi ﬁed in many genera of bacteria
since the intensi ﬁcation of glyphosate use ( Liu et al., 2013; Priestman
et al., 2005; Staub et al., 2012 ). This resistance could have come about
by various mechanisms other than horizontal gene transfer ( Table 2 ).
The mechanisms that provide resistance to glyphosate in bacteria are
similar to those conveying resistance to glyphosate in plants. For exam-
ple, mutations of the gene coding for the target site EPSP synthase and ofefﬂux transporter genes have been found in plants and bacteria ( Fei
et al., 2013; Priestman et al., 2005; Staub et al., 2012 ). In addition, bacte-
ria could be selected that produce glyphosate degradation enzymes
(Arunakumara et al., 2013; Singh and Singh, 2016; Sviridov et al.,
2015; Travaglia et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2015 ). Or bacteria could circum-
vent some of the harmful effects of glyphosate by increasing the produc-tion of molecules that scavenge free radicals ( Liu et al., 2013 ).
Some of the mechanisms conferring resistance to glyphosate in bac-
teria also confer resistance to clinically important antimicrobial agents
(Kurenbach et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013 ). For example, the reduction of
Fig. 1. Relative number of scienti ﬁcp u b l i c a t i o n s( ▲) on antibiotic resistance in soil, waste
water and natural water (70 in 2016), relative total glyphosate use in the USA ( ●) and
worldwide ( ■) (127 million and 900 million kg, respectively, in 2016) between 1960
and 2016 ( Benbrook, 2016; Cantas et al., 2013; USDA NASS, 2014 ).262 A.H.C. Van Bruggen et al. / Science of the Total Environment 616 –617 (2018) 255 –268

harmful radicals by mycothiol (a speci ﬁc thiol compound found in
Actinobacteria that scavenges free radicals) provides resistance not
only to glyphosate but also to a wide range of antibiotics including the
beta lactam antibiotic penicillin G ( Liu et al., 2013 ). Another example
is the modi ﬁcation of the AcrAB ef ﬂux pump in E. coli that had been ex-
posed to glyphosate (1240 mg l−1), which was associated with an in-
crease in resistance from 0.03 to 0.09 mg l−1of the ﬂuoroquinolone
antibiotic Cipro ﬂoxacin (Cip) and from 5 to 20 mg l−1of the aminogly-
coside antibiotic Kanamycin (Kan) ( Kurenbach et al., 2015 ). Similarly,
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was more resistant to Cip at
0.08 mg l−1and to Kan at 8 –40 mg l−1after exposure to glyphosate,
but potential changes in ef ﬂux pump were not investigated
(Kurenbach et al., 2015 ). Cip and Kan are used as alternative antibiotics
to control pathogens that are insensitive to beta lactam antibiotics suchas penicillin, ampicillin and cephalosporin. Resistance to Cip and Kan
would reduce the spectrum of clinically useful antibiotics even further.
Beta lactam resistant bacteria commonly produce Extended Spec-
trum Beta Lactamase (ESBL), an enzyme that breaks down beta lactam
antibiotics and thus confers resistance to these antibiotics
(Apostolakos et al., 2017; Brolund, 2014 ). ESBL production has been as-
sociated with ﬁeld induced glyphosate-resistance, in particular in vari-
ous species of Enterobacteriaceae ( Krüger and Shehata, 2014 ). We
isolated unidenti ﬁed bacteria ( n= 101) from citrus roots and rhizo-
spheres ( Shin et al., 2016; Shin and van Bruggen, 2017 ). In agreement
with the ﬁndings by Krüger and Shehata (2014) , the bacteria showed
cross resistance (64% of the colonies) to Roundup® (7000 mg l
−1glyph-
osate) on penicillin-amended (20 mg l−1) agar ( Table 4 ). Penicillin is
not used in citrus orchards and penicillin resistance is hard to explain,
except via cross resistance with glyphosate, which is applied frequently
in citrus groves ( Shin et al., 2016 ). Of the bacterial isolates that had not
been exposed to penicillin or glyphosate, 39% were able to grow on theglyphosate amended medium ( Table 4 ). In a related experiment ( Shin
and van Bruggen, 2017 ), 95% of unidenti ﬁed bacteria isolated on plates
with glyphosate amended medium (7000 mg l
−1) from citrus groves
were resistant to penicillin (20 mg l−1), while only 15 –20% of these bac-
teria were resistant to streptomycin (50 mg l−1) or tetracycline
(16 mg l−1)(Table 5 ). A slightly lower proportion (88% compared to
95%) of bacteria that had not been exposed to glyphosate in the isolation
medium grew on the penicillin amended medium, while a much higher
proportion (48 –63% compared to 15 –20%) grew on media amended
with streptomycin or tetracycline, which can be used in citrus groves
to control citrus canker (caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pathovar
citri). Altogether, this suggests that cross resistance between glyphosate
and penicillin may be more common in citrus groves than cross resis-
tance between glyphosate and streptomycin or tetracycline. The mech-
anisms underlying the glyphosate and antibiotic resistance have not
been elucidated.
Similar to the effects of glyphosate on microbial communities, the
herbicides that will increasingly replace glyphosate, dicamba and 2,4-
D, also have differential effects on microorganisms ( Oleszczuk et al.,
2014; Seghers et al., 2003 ). The mechanisms that convey resistance to
herbicides in plants are largely similar to those conferring resistanceto herbicides in microorganisms. Thus, insensitivity to dicamba and
2,4-D will likely increase in microbial communities after intensi ﬁcation
of the use of these herbicides. Finally, similar to the association betweenglyphosate and antibiotic resistance in microorganisms, insensitivity to
dicamba and 2,4-D is often accompanied by antibiotic resistance
(Kurenbach et al., 2015 ). Ultimately, antibiotic-resistant bacteria will
likely be transferred from agricultural ﬁelds to farm animals and
human patients in the hospital environment ( Smith et al., 2005; Stine
et al., 2007 ).
5. Discussion and conclusions
Due to the almost exponential increase in glyphosate use and the
slow decomposition of glyphosate and its breakdown product AMPAin soil, water and sediment, the accumulation of glyphosate in the envi-
ronment, plant products and animal organs has become quite worri-
some ( Myers et al., 2016; Shehata et al., 2014 ). In particular, the high
proportion of people and farm animals with glyphosate in their urineis concerning, even though the concentrations are still low ( Niemann
et al., 2015 ). Although the acute toxic effects of glyphosate on ﬁsh and
mammals are low, the formulated products often are more toxic thanglyphosate itself, and concerns have emerged about chronic effects of
the formulated products on human and animal diseases, in particular
various forms of cancer and mental disorders ( Fortes et al., 2016;
Mesnage et al., 2015a, 2015b; Swanson et al., 2014 ). Although conclu-
sions regarding possible carcinogenicity and other health effects of
glyphosate remain controversial, we feel that suf ﬁcient additional data
has accumulated regarding the chronic toxic effects of the formulatedproducts on aquatic and terrestrial animals and humans to warrant re-
consideration of the tolerable residue levels of glyphosate and AMPA
in plant and animal products and the environment. The recent reclassi-
ﬁcation of glyphosate as probably carcinogenic by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization(WHO) was based primarily on research with the main formulated
product Roundup® ( IARC, 2015; Séralini et al., 2014 ). Additional re-
search is needed to come to a de ﬁnitive conclusion on the chronic
health effects of the various formulated products containing glyphosate.
In addition to the possible chronic direct health effects of glyphosate
on a variety of aquatic and terrestrial animals and humans, we docu-
mented shifts in microbial communities in soil, plants, water and intes-
tinal tracts and the association with speci ﬁc plant and animal pathogens
(Ackermann et al., 2015; Priestman et al., 2005; Sanogo et al., 2000,
2001 ). The shifts in microbiomes resulting from intensive glyphosate
use can affect resistance mechanisms and have severe impacts onplant, animal and human health ( Hoffman et al., 2015 ). These complex,
indirect effects of glyphosate need to be taken into account by regulato-ry agencies.
Other indirect health effects can come about through the recently
documented cross resistance to glyphosate and clinically important an-
tibi
otics ( Kurenbach et al., 2015 ). The surge in antibiotic resistance has
been attributed primarily to the increased use of antibiotics by humanpatients and farm animals ( Smith et al., 2005; Stine et al., 2007 ), butTable 4

antibiotic resistance is also widespread in agricultural soils that were
not exposed to high antibiotic concentrations ( Udikovic-Kolic et al.,
2014 ). Considering that subsets of the microbiomes in soil transfer to
plants, fresh plant products, animal and human intestinal tracts ( Berg
et al., 2014 ), and then to excrements that return to soil and water, we
suggest that there are microbial cycles that are characteristic for partic-
ular management systems. Management of weeds with multiple glyph-osate applications could result in microbiomes that are relatively
glyphosate and antibiotic resistant. This leads us to the hypothesis that
the selection pressure for glyphosate-resistance and the associated re-
sistance to antibiotics in the soil microbiome result in transfer of antibi-
otic resistant bacteria from soil to plants, animals and humans through
t h ef o o dw e b ,e v e ni nu r b a na n dh o s p i t a le n v i r o n m e n t s .
The sequence of events outlined here for glyphosate, namely intro-
duction of glyphosate resistant crops, intensi ﬁcation of glyphosate use,
emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and microorganisms, changesin microbiomes and disease resistance, deteriorated plant and animal
health, and increased antibiotic resistance, could serve as a harbinger
for events to follow the introduction of genes conferring resistance to
other herbicides. The recent addition of genes for resistance to the her-
bicides dicamba and 2,4-D to glyphosate resistant crops ( Ruen et al.,
2017 ) will likely result in additional increases in herbicide use and un-
intended side effects ( Leon et al., 2016 ). Weeds with multiple herbicide
resistance at multiple sites of action have been detected already ( Bell
et al., 2013 ). Similar to glyphosate, dicamba and 2,4-D have differential
effects on microorganisms, and shifts in plant and animal microbiomescan be expected as a result of intensi ﬁcation of the use of dicamba and
2,4-D ( Oleszczuk et al., 2014; Seghers et al., 2003 ). The mechanisms
that convey resistance to herbicides in plants are largely similar to
those conferring resistance to herbicides in microorganisms, and thus,
insensitivity to herbicides other than glyphosate will likely also increase
in microbial communities, possibly followed by increased antibiotic re-
sistance. These wide-ranging consequences of intensive herbicide use
have not been pointed out previously.
In conclusion, we suggest that the problems associated with the
large scale and intensive use of glyphosate (and other herbicides in
the future) are much more encompassing than originally anticipated
by the regulatory agencies ( EPA, 2013 ). We recommend additional in-
terdisciplinary research on the associations between low level chronicherbicide exposure, distortions in microbial communities, expansionof antibiotic resistance and the emergence of animal, human and plant
diseases. Independent research is needed to revisit the tolerance thresh-
olds for glyphosate residues in water, food and animal feed taking all
possible health risks into account. A global effort will be needed to col-
lect appropriate high quality residue and health data across the range of
settings in which glyphosate and other herbicides are used; only as such
data become available will we be able to design, develop and implement
strategies to counter further escalation of the problems associated with
the use of glyphosate and other herbicides.
