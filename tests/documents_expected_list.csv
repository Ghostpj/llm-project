9,Article,Environmental-and-health-effects-of-the-herbicide-glyphosate.txt,Easy question,Can you name one way glyphosate affects plant health?,"Glyphosate affects plant health by inhibiting the production of aromatic amino acids, leading to reduced plant resistance to pathogens and increased susceptibility to infection. It also affects photosynthesis and can cause yellowing and necrosis of foliage.(Section 3.1: Effects on plants)"
10,Article,Environmental-and-health-effects-of-the-herbicide-glyphosate.txt,Difficult question,How does glyphosate potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance?,"Glyphosate may contribute to antibiotic resistance by exerting selective pressure on microbial communities, leading to shifts in composition that favor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This is due to its widespread use and accumulation in the environment. (Section 4: Resistance to glyphosate and antibiotics)"
