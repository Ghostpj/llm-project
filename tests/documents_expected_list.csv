15,Article,Procollagen-C-proteinase-enhancer-1.txt,Difficult question,Describe in detail how PCPE-1 enhances the maturation of procollagen by BMP-1/tolloid-like proteinases (BTPs). What is the significance of this process in the context of fibrosis?,"PCPE-1 enhances the maturation of procollagen by specifically stimulating the removal of C-propeptides (CP) from fibrillar procollagens I, II, and III by BMP-1/tolloid-like proteinases (BTPs). It achieves this by binding with nanomolar affinity to procollagen molecules, increasing the catalytic efficiency of BMP-1 significantly. This specific action of PCPE-1 on procollagen maturation is crucial in fibrosis, as it contributes to the regulated formation of collagen fibrils. "
